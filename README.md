# Desserts üßÅ

![Getting Started](./Screenshots/Dessert-Poster.jpg)

## Motivation

The Desserts app leverages the following APIs:

1. https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Dessert
2. https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=MEAL_ID

The app is designed to display a list of desserts and detailed information about each dessert to the user.

## Features

1. **iOS and iPadOS Compatibility**: Utilizes the `NavigationSplitView` API to provide seamless navigation across devices.

2. **Image Caching**: Implements caching for `AsyncImage`, minimizing network calls and improving scrolling performance in the dessert list.

3. **Automatic Data Re-fetch**: Automatically re-fetches data when the app transitions from offline to online states.

4. **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for desserts by name within the dessert list.

5. **Light and Dark Mode Support**: Ensures a consistent and pleasing user experience in both light and dark modes.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the recruitment team at Fetch for providing me with this opportunity to work on this take-home assignment. It has been an invaluable learning experience.

Having primarily worked with Core Data in SwiftUI, this project was my first foray into fetching and displaying data from an API using SwiftUI. While the concepts are not entirely new to me‚Äîthanks to my experience with similar projects in UIKit‚Äîimplementing them in SwiftUI has been a rewarding challenge.

I am excited about the possibility of advancing to the next stages of the recruitment process and look forward to the opportunity to contribute further.
